Schedule V: PSU Motion to C&S

PSU Executive’s Motion

to Clubs & Societies

Council

The PSU Executive would like to bring forward the following motion to Clubs & Societies Council.

‘Motion to grant a representative of the postgraduate students union a seat, as a voting member,

on the Clubs and Societies Executive’

Justification and reasoning:

The University of Limerick Postgraduate Students’ Union (PSU) would first like to acknowledge
the work and commitment shown by not only the committee members of each individual Club
& Society, but also the Clubs & Societies Executive, CS Administrator Michelle Whyte and CS
Development Officer Paul Lee in the overall development of Clubs and Societies.

45



The PSU receives approximately €140,000 annually from the University through student capitation
which comes directly from our members. Following the wages of the PSU President, the 2/3 split in
capitation provides C&S with approximately €77,000.

Our accountant has advised us that due to this large portion of funding being transferred to C&S,
we have a duty to our members to be able to provide oversight on how this money is
administered. We have complete faith in the Clubs & Societies Executive in administering this
money. Year after year, Clubs & Societies have proven themselves to be responsible with the
money given to them. The PSU Executive is not implying that it is not done well, however we do
have a duty to our members to be able to oversee the process.

This will help to strengthen the ties between us and would be mutually beneficial as the PSU
Executive would also like to create a position for a C&S Representative on our Executive. This
individuals’ function would be similar to that of the Clubs Officer and Societies Officer on the SU

Executive, but their focus would be on advising and helping the PSU Executive to promote and
market C&S to the Universities postgraduate students. Given that only ***** of an estimated
4,000 postgraduate students are members we feel it is very important that this is accomplished.

Having representatives on one another’s executives will also provide us with an opportunity to learn
from one another, but also to promote common causes between the PSU, CSEXEC and SU – most
notably the student levy referendum to be put to the students next semester.

According to the Guide to C&S Administration 2012/2013 (pg40) and C&S Rulebook 2007 (pg42), the

Students’ Union President has full voting rights as an SU Representative and we would seek that
our representative from the PSU would be granted these same rights.

46
